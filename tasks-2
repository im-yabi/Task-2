1.write a blog on difference document and window object

he document object represents a web page that is loaded in the browser. By accessing the document object, we can access the element in the HTML page. With the help of document objects, we can add dynamic content to our web page. The document object can be accessed with a window.document or just document.

Syntax:
      document.property_name;

When JavaScript is executed inside the browser, the window object is the JavaScript Global object. The document object is a property of the window object.

The window object represents the browser window.
The document object represents the HTML document loaded in that window.

The window object has many useful properties like the location object and the setTimeout function.

Since the window object is the Global object, ergo, it is the end of all scope chains, you don’t have to explicitly specify it when accessing its properties…
Instead of window.setTimeout, you can just write setTimeout
Same goes with document… instead of window.document, you can just write document…



Window Vs Document
Window object : It is the top most object and outermost element of the object hierarchy as shown in Figure 1.

Document object : Each HTML document that gets loaded into a window becomes a document object. The document contains the contents of the page. Using document object, JavaScript can modify, add and delete the HTML elements, attributes CSS styles in the page

The window object represents a window/tab containing a DOM document where as document object is property of window object that points to the DOM document loaded in that window.

You can access a document object either using window.document property or using document object directly as window is global object. In the below example, title is the property of document object.


The other major difference is that both window object and document object have properties and methods. Few method names are same in both objects but with different behavior. In the below example window.open() opens a new tab or window and document.open() creates a blank document within the window.


Screen
Screen is the window property that holds information of browser screen. It refers to screen object associated with that window object. Used to display screen width, height, colorDepth, pixelDepth etc

Similar to document screen can be accessed either by window.screen or screen object directly. Screen object doesn't have any methods as in window and document objects.
